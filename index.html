      <h2>About:</h2>
      <p>
        With 30 years of experience in fine art, graphic design, content creation, sound design, and audio production, I emphasize functional minimalism, utilizing color and composition as primary design tools.<br><br>
        
        I prioritize understanding the 'why' in design, leveraging design thinking and focusing on user experience. Whether it's an app, website, or product, my goal is to ensure the end result fits the domain it's created for, making these principles integral to my approach.<br><br>
        
        In my work, I am focused on innovation, aiming to create designs that are both distinctive and memorable. I emphasize user interface design and UX principles, ensuring a seamless and engaging experience for users. Additionally, I explore digital marketing strategies and new approaches to enhance the reach and impact of my projects.<br><br>
        
        I believe in the power of thoughtful design to solve problems and create meaningful connections. My approach is holistic, considering every aspect of the user journey and aligning with client and project objectives to deliver exceptional results.<br><br>
        
        My methodology is experimental and forward-thinking, incorporating a hybrid use of AI tools, human creativity, chance, and ideation. This blend of technology and creativity allows me to push boundaries and deliver innovative solutions. The streamlined approach of AI enables a prototypical method to iteratively find the best and most suited solutions and outcomes.
